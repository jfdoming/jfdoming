# Overview
This is an introduction to some of the various projects on my GitHub profile! Check out any of the sections below for details about some of the cool projects I've worked on and contributed to. A common theme among many of these projects is that there was a topic I was curious about, for which a library already existed, but I wanted to "roll my own" to gain a deeper understanding of how one might approach the problem. The projects are organized by primary language, and ordered within each section by "coolness" factor arbitrarily assigned by me.

## Miscellaneous

### [Sketches](https://github.com/jfdoming/sketches)
Whenever I start a new project as an experiment (mostly mathematical projects) that project winds its way into this repository. Some recent examples include a double pendulum simulation and a complex function graphing calculator.

### [dotfiles](https://github.com/jfdoming/dotfiles)
After setting up a few new installations of Linux and starting two new internships, I noticed my setup process tended to be mostly the same: add some bash and vim configuration options, download my preferred terminal emulator, and install some vim plugins. Since configuration files are meant to be saved anyway, I figured, why not upload these on GitHub so that I have easy access? (And others can borrow what they like as well! ðŸ˜‰)


## C++

### [DSA](https://github.com/jfdoming/dsa)
As the README describes, this project contains "implementations of various data structures and algorithms for the purpose of learning." Essentially, whenever there's a new algorithm I want to try out, if it can be written in C++, it will end up here!

### [ChatLang](https://github.com/jfdoming/ChatLang)
This is a programming language created entirely by myself and [Jessica Zhang](https://github.com/jessicazhang236) over the course of the 22-day `Repl.it` language Jam, for the purpose of exploring an idea called "algebraic effects" as well as some other quirky syntactic sugar. Visit the repository for more detailed information, and to try out the language yourself!

### cc3k+
This is a game I developed with two friends for a school course, but we might have tried just a bit too hard, and ended up with a really cool peer-to-peer multiplayer dungeon crawler! Unfortunately, the link isn't available publicly due to university policy, but feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:jfdoming@uwaterloo.ca) and I'd be happy to grant you access!

### [Aela](https://github.com/jfdoming/Aela)
This is a custom game engine I developed with a few friends. It has lots of features, you should check out the repository for more information!


## JavaScript

### [uwaterloo-cs-userscripts](https://github.com/jfdoming/uwaterloo-cs-userscripts)
In many computer science courses at the University of Waterloo, students have to use online systems to submit their assignments which are, at best, slightly dated. Recognizing this problem, I wrote a couple of client-side "userscripts" which make the experience on these sites much better!

### [dcheck](https://github.com/jfdoming/dcheck)
It's always a hassle for me to figure out whether a course I want to take is offered next term. This information is available online, but not in an easily-searchable format. `dcheck` is nothing more than a simple form box with autocomplete, but the amount of time it's saved me with planning is immeasurable.

### [libstudent](https://github.com/jfdoming/libstudent)
I've always loved tracking my progress within my courses in school, because it makes me feel more on top of things (even if I'm not). To that end, I built this calculator, which helps me keep track of whether I'm meeting my goals for each class.

### [SCL](https://github.com/jfdoming/scl)
This was my first foray into the world of source code execution (specifically, interpreted languages). I started this project well before I took CS 241 (Waterloo's course on compilers) so it was rather _interesting_ to come back and look at what I had written before I had any knowledge on the subject!

### [Tweeter](https://github.com/jfdoming/tweeter)
This is a social media simulation (no, it's not based on Twitter, I wouldn't do that...) which I created for the (open-ended) final project of an English course I took. You can view a live demo [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jfdoming/tweeter/blob/master/index.html).

### [Evego](https://github.com/jfdoming/Evego)
This is a hackathon project where I learned how to use React Native and the Google Maps API.


## Python

## [TD Scraper](https://github.com/jfdoming/td-scraper)
After moving to university, I started needing to track my expenses more carefully (for tax purposes). Unfortunately, the web portal my bank provides (TD EasyWeb) does not have the ability to edit transaction data (as far as I know). Therefore, it made sense to track this information in a spreadsheet! After a while, updating the spreadsheet got quite tedious, so I wanted a better way to get the data from TD's web portal into my spreadsheet. Since they don't provide an API, this project was born.


## Java

### [JDACBL](https://github.com/jfdoming/jdacbl)
JDACBL is a command-based API for creating Discord bots in Java. It relies on the popular Java bindings for the Discord API, [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA). It allows you to quickly and easily create bots that respond to user input. Visit the repository homepage to learn more! (You can also find an example of how to use the API [here](https://github.com/jfdoming/slavabot).)

### [ProcessingUI](https://github.com/jfdoming/ProcessingUI)
This is a library for the open-source [Processing framework](https://processing.org/) which adds some GUI capabilities to the language (such as text/password input, buttons, etc.). The project was done as an experiment to help me understand the thought that goes into UI libraries.

### [Phusics](https://github.com/jfdoming/phusics)
This is a framework for basic physics simulations in plain Swing-based Java. The project was my first experience with the complexities surrounding numerical computation, and specifically numerical integration.
